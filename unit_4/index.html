	<p id="first">The Technology Consulting Group is an independent consultancy made up of I.T. professionals who work in the industry not as full time consultants but as specialists in their field. This enables us to draw on people who experience the challenges of making technology work day to day</p>

	<p>Our mission is to help our customers achieve the best possible outcomes through developing strategies, helping in design and procurement of infrastructure or systems. Using our network of consultants we can also help existing IT teams with interim management assignments and where necessary coaching or redesign of existing IT functions to achieve fantastic results.</p>

	<p>Our consultants are what differentiates us from the rest of the market. We choose to work with consultants who are respected in their field and who have significant experience working as part of a business. Because our consultants only devote part of their time to consulting engagements we ensure that they are always working with technology unlike traditional consulting houses employing full time consultants that HAD experience in situations that face your businesses today. By utilising a network of consultants in this way we retain a network of tried and tested vendors who we know and trust to work with you as part of our solutions.</p>
